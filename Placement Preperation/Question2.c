/*Sumita and equal array
Problem Statement:
Sumita is playing with a Array A of size N. she wants to make all the values of A to be equal. she can multiply any value any number of times by X, Y and Z. Your task is to tell her whether she can do it or not. Print "She can" if she can do it else print "She can't" without ""

Input:
First line of the input will contain T (No. of test cases).
For each test case, first line will contain four space separated integers denoting N, X, Y and Z.
Then next line will contain N space separated integers of A

Output:
For every test case, print the required answer in a new line.

Constraints:
1 ≤ T ≤ 5
2 ≤ N ≤ 10^5
X, Y, Z ∈ {2, 3, 5, 7}
1 ≤ Ai ≤ 10^9

Time Limit:
1 sec

Example 1:
Input
2
2 2 2 2
2 4
3 2 3 2
2 6 7

Output
